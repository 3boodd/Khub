# KSS

## Easy CSS for BetterDiscord.

## What is this?

KSS is a JavaScript library and a form of CSS made for BetterDiscord theme developers.

## Theme developers? What?

### You read that right, theme developers.

Have you ever tried styling Discord using a plugin?

It's easier than you think with KSS, even if you don't know much JavaScript!

## Why not just use pure CSS? Why a plugin?

Using KSS/a plugin to style Discord gives you many advantages over pure CSS.

Here is a list of just some of them.

 * Automatic updating like plugins with easy changelogs.
 * More complex theme settings.
   * Toggling entire modular stylesheets on and off.
   * A file picker to let your users upload their own background.
 * No (or at least much less) forcing your users to redownload your themes.
   * There is no main stylesheet, so no more redownloading to add/remove settings.
 * No re-disabling the cache to update your themes right away.
   * Your themes will update quickly, within minutes of an update being pushed.
 * More advanced styles using JavaScript and Discord's React data.
   * Ever been not quite able to find a solution using pure CSS? Using JavaScript you can.
